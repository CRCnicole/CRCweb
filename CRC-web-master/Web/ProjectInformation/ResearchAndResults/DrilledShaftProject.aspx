<p>The Columbia River Crossing (CRC) project conducted a construction techniques 
test project in March 2012. Through this research, CRC evaluated the strength of 
the soil and the construction techniques for the replacement Interstate 5 bridge 
support structures. Construction noise and vibration effects at nearby 
residences and businesses were monitored. The work will allow engineers to 
refine design assumptions and project plans, ensuring the construction phase for 
the CRC project stays on schedule and on budget.  </p>
<p>The work occurred just west of I-5 near the I-5/State Route 14 interchange in 
Washington and the Hayden Island interchange in Oregon. The two locations were 
chosen to represent a range of soil conditions and required foundation depths 
for the CRC bridges.</p>
				

<h2>What are drilled shafts and driven piles?</h2>
<p>Drilled shafts are deep, cylindrical holes into which concrete is poured for 
bridge foundations. A pile is a long, cylindrical steel column that is driven 
				into the soil to provide support for bridges and other 
				structures. Installation of driven piles can create noise 
				associated with metal striking metal. </p>

<h2>What specific work was done?</h2>
<p>Construction crews installed three drilled shafts and five piles. The three 
drilled shafts for this test project measured 6 feet, 8 feet and 10 feet in 
diameter and were installed 130 feet, 160 feet and 260 feet below ground level.</p>
				<p>Noise and vibration levels on land were monitored on Hayden 
				Island before and during testing to assess the effects of the 
				driven pile installation in the nearby communities. Four noise 
				monitors and seven vibration monitors were used to measure 
				effects of the test project. (See map for locations.).</p>
				
<h2>What were the test project&#39;s results?</h2>
				<p>The complete final report for the drilled shaft and driven pile test project is in process.</p>
				<h3>Vibration and sound results</h3>
				<p>Monitoring for sound and vibration during the pile driving 
				provided quantifiable information for construction of a 
				replacement Interstate 5 bridge.</p>
				<p>Ambient noise near the driven pile test study location was 
				dominated by vehicle traffic on I-5. Results of the vibration 
				and sound monitoring study found that people within 
				0.75 mile of pile
driving may hear the activity
over typical noise when they are
outdoors during construction. Noise from 
				pile driving is expected to be heard by people who are outdoors 
				up to 1,000 feet from the pile driving location. People within 
				2,000 feet may feel ground vibrations from pile driving.</p>
				<p>Based on the results, the level of vibration from pile 
				driving is not expected to cause any structural damage to nearby 
				buildings or structures, however, windows, dishes or loose items 
				on shelves could rattle during impact hammering during future 
				construction.</p>
				<p>More detailed information regarding the sound and vibration 
				results of the test pile project can be found in the
				<a target="_blank" href="/FileLibrary/TechnicalReports/Land_Based_Vibration_Monitoring_Report.pdf">
				final report</a>. </p>
